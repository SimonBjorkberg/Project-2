## [See the App!](https://monkee-hub.cyclic.app/)

## Description

The website we have developed is designed as a versatile forum that can be customized to cater to diverse communities.
 
## User Stories

- **404** - An error page is displayed when a user tries to access a page that is not available. It serves as a redirection mechanism to inform the user that the requested page cannot be found.
- **unauthorized** - The unauthorized route handles access restrictions and displays an error page when a user attempts to access a page without proper authentication or authorization. It serves as a mechanism to inform the user that they do not have the required permissions to access the requested content.
- **homepage** - The homepage is the central landing page of the website, serving as the initial entry point for users.
- **sign up** - The sign-up route enables new users to create an account on the web app. It provides a registration form where users can enter their information, such as username, email, and password, to create a account.
- **login** - The login route allows registered users to authenticate themselves and gain access to their account. It presents a login form where users can enter their credentials, username and password, to verify their identity and log in to the web app.
- **logout** - The logout route handles the process of ending a user's authenticated session. It invalidates the user's session token or cookies, effectively logging them out of the web app. It ensures that the user's session is terminated.
- **topics** - The topics route displays a list of threads available within the web app. It serves as a hub for users to explore and navigate different areas of interest or discussions within the the topics. 
- **threads** - The threads route presents a collection of posts within a particular thread. It provides a platform for users to engage in discussions by posting messages. Users can browse through threads to read and contribute to the ongoing conversations relevant to a specific thread.
